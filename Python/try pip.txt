Try Pip assignment

1. Pip is a package manager for Python frameworks, libraries, packages - I used pip to install Django, there was a install status bar during the process, when completed it stated I have Django-1.10.6

2. Pip list displays a list of all current packages on my machine, there are dozens

3. Requirement already satisfied - then a path to its location within site-packages

4. Pip list is just a list of installed packages, pip freeze is an output of packages in requirement format, this output can be written to a .txt file so that you can then use those packages in a virtualenv

5. There is not a requirements.txt file on the desktop that contains a list of all pip packages in requirements format

6. Successfully uninstalled Django

7. No output because Django does not exist on my machine, verified by pip list

8. Incredibly long list of Flask elements
